## TRIGGER: CRISIS
**POST:** Suicidal thoughts vs. intrusive thoughts

```
🆘 Crisis Triage Protocol

In crisis right now?

This isn't a hotline—it's a reality-check protocol.

---

**IF IN IMMEDIATE DANGER:**

☎️ Samaritans: 116 123 (24/7)
💬 Shout: Text 85258 (24/7)
🚨 999 or A&E if you have a plan

---

**THE CRITICAL DIFFERENCE:**

INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS:
• Pop up uninvited
• Feel alien and disturbing  
• You DON'T want to act on them
• Immediate horror: "Why did I think that?!"
• Escalate when stressed or understimulated

Example: "I could swerve into that wall" while driving

PASSIVE SUICIDAL IDEATION:
• "I wish I could just not exist"
• No active plan
• Persistent wish to disappear
• Feels like exhaustion more than intent
• Often tied to burnout/chronic pain/overwhelm

Example: "I don't want to die, I just want everything to stop"

ACTIVE SUICIDAL PLANNING:
• Specific method AND timeline
• Preparation (gathering means, writing notes)
• Sense of resolution or calm after deciding
• THIS IS THE MEDICAL EMERGENCY

---

**REALITY-CHECK QUESTIONS:**

Answer honestly:

□ Do I have a specific plan? (method + timeline)
□ Have I gathered means? (pills, rope, weapon)
□ Have I written goodbye notes or messages?
□ Do I feel calm/resolved about dying?
□ Am I saying goodbye to people?

**If YES to any → Call crisis line or go to A&E NOW**

□ Do these thoughts pop up uninvited?
□ Do they horrify me when they appear?
□ Do I actively NOT want to die?
□ Am I exhausted/burnt out/in chronic pain?

**If YES to these → Intrusive thoughts or passive ideation**

---

**IF YOU HAVE INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS:**

Step 1: NAME IT
"This is an intrusive thought. Not a plan. Not a desire."

Step 2: DON'T ENGAGE
Fighting the thought makes it stickier.
Acknowledge it. Let it pass.

Step 3: GET ASSESSED FOR OCD
Many people with "Pure O" (obsessional OCD) experience harm-related intrusions.
This is treatable.

Immediate management:
• Ground yourself (5 things you see, 4 you hear, 3 you touch)
• Move your body (walk, stretch, change position)
• Call someone (breaks the thought loop)

---

**IF YOU'RE IN PASSIVE IDEATION:**

This often means: BURNOUT

Check:
□ Am I sleeping? (less than 6 hours = crisis)
□ Am I eating? (skipping meals = crisis)
□ Have I had a break? (no rest in weeks/months)
□ Am I in chronic pain? (makes everything worse)
□ Am I isolated? (no human contact in days)

Emergency burnout protocol:

Next 24 hours:
□ Cancel ALL non-essentials
□ Sleep as much as possible
□ Eat something (even if not hungry)
□ Text someone: "I'm in passive ideation. Not planning anything. Just need you to know."

Next 48-72 hours:
□ Reduce demand to MINIMUM
□ Take sick leave if working
□ Ask for help (groceries, childcare, anything)
□ See GP (can sign you off work, refer to crisis team)

---

**DISCLOSURE SCRIPTS:**

To GP/therapist:
"I'm having thoughts about not wanting to be alive, but I don't have a plan and I'm not in immediate danger. I think this is [burnout/intrusive thoughts/medication side effect]. I need help managing this, NOT hospitalization."

To trusted person:
"I'm having dark thoughts. Not planning anything. Just exhausted. Can you [check in daily / help with X / just be present]?"

To partner:
"I'm struggling with passive suicidal ideation. This means I'm overwhelmed, not that I have a plan. I need [space / support / reduced demands]. I'll tell you if it escalates."

---

**WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW:**

Immediate (next 5 minutes):
□ Put phone down somewhere visible (accountability)
□ Drink water (dehydration worsens mental state)
□ Open window or go outside (environment change)

Next hour:
□ Text someone you trust
□ Do NOT be alone (go to public space if needed)
□ Remove means if accessible (pills, sharps, etc.)

Today:
□ Call GP for emergency appointment
□ Contact crisis team if GP unavailable
□ Stay with someone overnight if possible

---

**HOSPITALIZATION DECISION:**

When YOU should go to A&E:
• You have a plan and means
• You've started preparing (gathering items, writing notes)
• You feel you can't keep yourself safe
• You've already attempted

When NOT hospitalization:
• Intrusive thoughts that horrify you
• Passive ideation with no plan
• Burnout exhaustion

(You can still get help without being hospitalized)

---

**WHY ND PEOPLE EXPERIENCE THIS MORE:**

Higher rates due to:
• OCD traits (intrusive thoughts)
• Chronic burnout (nervous system collapse)
• RSD (rejection feels like death)
• Sensory overload (world is too much)
• Masking exhaustion (can't keep pretending)
• Isolation (hard to connect with NTs)

This is CONTEXT, not excuse.
You still need help.

---

**INTRUSIVE THOUGHT MANAGEMENT:**

These thoughts are not YOU:
• They're your brain's version of spam email
• Anxiety generates "what if" scenarios
• OCD brains test boundaries with disturbing thoughts
• They mean NOTHING about your character

Do NOT:
✗ Try to suppress them (makes them worse)
✗ Analyze why you had them (feeds the loop)
✗ Test if you "really" want to do it

DO:
✓ Acknowledge: "There's that thought again"
✓ Redirect: Move attention elsewhere
✓ Seek ERP therapy (Exposure Response Prevention)

---

**PASSIVE IDEATION MANAGEMENT:**

This is your brain saying:  
"The current situation is unsustainable"

Not: "I want to die"
But: "I can't keep living LIKE THIS"

Action plan:
1. Identify what's unsustainable
   (Job? Relationship? Living situation? Chronic illness?)

2. Reduce that demand IMMEDIATELY
   (Quit, leave, ask for accommodations, get treatment)

3. Don't wait for "right time"
   Your brain is telling you it's an emergency

---

**CRISIS SAFETY PLAN TEMPLATE:**

Fill this out NOW (while safe):

Warning signs I'm declining:
1. ___________
2. ___________
3. ___________

People I can contact:
Name: ___________ Phone: ___________
Name: ___________ Phone: ___________

---

**MEDICATION CONSIDERATION:**

If this is recurring:

Talk to GP about:
• Antidepressants (especially if burnout-related)
• Anti-anxiety meds (if intrusive thoughts)
• ADHD meds review (can worsen or improve depending)

Be specific:
"I'm experiencing [passive ideation/intrusive thoughts]. Not in crisis but it's persistent. What medication options are there?"

## TRIGGER: EVICTION
**POST:** Eviction, rent arrears, and housing instability

```
🏠 Emergency Housing Triage Plan

Facing eviction or arrears right now?

This isn't about money—it's about executive function.

---

**IF YOU RECEIVED EVICTION NOTICE:**

☎️ Shelter: 0808 800 4444 (FREE urgent help)
📞 Citizens Advice: Local office (Google "[your area] citizens advice")

DO NOT IGNORE THE NOTICE.
This will not go away.

---

**EMERGENCY TRIAGE (Do Today):**

Step 1: CHECK THE DATE
How long until court hearing? ___________
(Usually 2-4 weeks from notice)

Step 2: CALCULATE THE GAP
Total arrears: £___________
Can you pay any now?: £___________
Can you pay monthly?: £___________ /month

Step 3: CONTACT LANDLORD
Don't avoid. Use script:

"I've received the notice. I want to resolve this. I can pay £___ now and £___ per month until cleared. Can we agree to this in writing?"

---

**WHY THIS HAPPENS TO ND PEOPLE:**

Not about money.
About executive dysfunction:

□ Task initiation failure (have money, can't make yourself pay)
□ Paperwork paralysis (forms are overwhelming)
□ Communication avoidance (landlord texts trigger shame)
□ Impulsive spending (rent money spent on dopamine hits)
□ Sensory housing mismatch (move frequently = instability)

The cascade:
Missed payment → arrears → notice → court → eviction → bad reference → harder to rent → cycle continues

---

**IF YOU HAVE THE MONEY BUT CAN'T PAY:**

This is PURE executive dysfunction.

You need infrastructure:

□ Standing order (not direct debit)
  Set once, never think about it again

□ Payment on payday
  Rent leaves account same day money arrives

□ Separate bills account
  Open account just for bills
  Money in, rent out, never touch it

□ Body double
  Ask someone to sit with you while you set it up

---

**SETTING UP STANDING ORDER (Step-by-step):**

1. Log into banking app
2. Go to "Payments" or "Standing Orders"
3. Add new standing order
4. Enter:
   - Landlord name
   - Landlord sort code + account number
   - Amount: £___________ (rent amount)
   - Start date: [your payday]
   - Frequency: Monthly
   - Reference: [your address or name]

5. SAVE IT
6. Screenshot confirmation
7. Send screenshot to landlord

Done. Never think about it again.

---

**IF YOU'RE IN ARREARS (Haven't received notice):**

Propose payment plan NOW:

Template message to landlord:

"Hi [Landlord],

I'm £___ behind on rent. I want to clear this.

I can pay:
• £___ immediately  
• £___ per month until cleared

Can we agree to this plan in writing?

I've also set up a standing order for future rent to ensure this doesn't happen again.

[Your name]"

---

**IF YOU'VE RECEIVED COURT SUMMONS:**

YOU MUST ATTEND.

If you don't attend: Automatic eviction order.

What to bring:
□ Evidence of arrears amount
□ Evidence of any payments made
□ Proposed payment plan
□ Evidence of income (payslips, benefits letter)
□ Evidence of disability (ADHD diagnosis, PIP award)

Script for judge:
"I acknowledge the arrears. I've struggled with executive function due to ADHD. I've now set up automatic payment. I'm proposing £___ per month to clear arrears. I can provide evidence of my disability."

Judges are more lenient with:
• Disability context
• Payment plan proposal
• Evidence you've fixed the system

---

**BENEFIT CLAIMS (If eligible):**

Universal Credit includes housing element.

Apply even if:
• You're working (can still get partial UC)
• You're not sure you qualify
• It seems complicated

Claims take 5+ weeks.
Apply NOW.

SOR7ED can fill out the form with you.

---

**DISCLOSURE TO LANDLORD:**

You are NOT required to disclose ND status.

But saying this can help:

"I have a disability that affects executive function. I've set up automatic payments to ensure reliability going forward."

This is reasonable accommodation request.
Get it in writing.

---

**SUPPORTED HOUSING:**

If you keep cycling through housing:

Ask local council about:
• Supported housing schemes
• Housing with support worker
• Step-down accommodation

More structure = less exec function demand

---

**PREVENTING FUTURE ARREARS:**

Automation checklist:
□ Standing order for rent (payday)
□ Separate bills account
□ Utility direct debits
□ Council tax direct debit

Never rely on manual payments.
Your brain WILL forget.

---

**EMERGENCY ACCOMMODATION:**

If evicted:

Contact same day:
• Local council homeless prevention team
• Shelter
• Crisis

You have right to emergency housing if:
• You're vulnerable (disability counts)
• You have children
• You're genuinely homeless

Don't sleep rough.
There are options.

---

**SCRIPTS:**

To landlord (first contact):
"I'm behind on rent. I want to resolve this. Can we discuss a payment plan?"

To council (if evicted):
"I'm facing homelessness due to eviction. I have [ADHD/disability]. I need emergency accommodation. Who do I speak to?"

To Shelter:
"I've received [notice/court summons]. I need help understanding my options and rights."

---

**COURT PREP:**

If it goes to court:

What helps your case:
✓ Proposing realistic payment plan
✓ Evidence of disability
✓ Evidence you've fixed the system (standing order)
✓ Showing you've engaged (responded to letters)

What hurts your case:
✗ Not attending
✗ No payment plan
✗ No acknowledgment of problem
✗ Continuing to miss payments

---

**LONGER-TERM HOUSING STABILITY:**

If this keeps happening:

Root causes:
□ Wrong housing type (need supported housing)
□ Wrong location (too expensive)
□ No benefits claimed (eligible but not receiving)
□ No accommodations (need payment support)

Action:
1. Get PIP assessment (if not already receiving)
2. Request supported housing
3. Downsize if rent is unsustainable
4. Consider house share (splits bills, adds accountability)

---

**UK RESOURCES:**

• Shelter: 0808 800 4444 (free housing advice)
• Citizens Advice: citizensadvice.org.uk (local offices)
• StepChange: 0800 138 1111 (debt + arrears)
• Council housing options: Call local council
• Crisis: crisis.org.uk (homelessness charity)

---

What SOR7ED can help with:
• Setting up standing orders (we'll do it WITH you)
• Contacting landlord (we'll draft + send message)
• Filling out UC forms (body-doubling through entire process)
• Finding advocacy services (local to you)
• Court prep (what to say, what to bring)

We can't pay your rent.
But we can remove the executive function barriers.

Reply anytime.

## TRIGGER: ADHDPARENT
**POST:** Parenting with ADHD: The quiet shame loop nobody sees

```
👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 ADHD Parenting Survival Kit

Overstimulated and about to snap at your kids again?

You're not a bad parent.
You're an overstimulated one.

---

**IF YOU'RE ABOUT TO EXPLODE RIGHT NOW:**

Step 1: LEAVE THE ROOM
Tell kids: "Mummy/Daddy needs 3 minutes"
Lock bathroom door if needed

Step 2: COLD WATER
Face + wrists under cold tap
Breaks the nervous system loop

Step 3: BREATHE
In for 4, hold 4, out for 6
Repeat 3 times

Step 4: RETURN
"Sorry I needed a break. Let's try again."

---

**THE SHAME LOOP:**

1. Overwhelm → You snap at child
2. Regret → "I'm the worst parent ever"
3. Overcompensate → Try to be "perfect" for next hour
4. Burnout → Crash, back to Overwhelm

This loop is EXHAUSTING.
And it's not helping your kids.

---

**WHY ND PARENTING IS HARDER:**

Parenting is sensory hell:
• Kids are LOUD (constant noise triggers fight/flight)
• Kids are STICKY (tactile overwhelm)
• Kids are DEMANDING (constant interruptions)
• Kids are UNPREDICTABLE (can't plan, can't regulate)

For ADHD brain:
• Low dopamine = irritability
• Sensory sensitivity = overstimulation
• Executive dysfunction = can't manage routines
• Time blindness = always late to school/appointments
• RSD = "my kid doesn't like me" spiral

Result: You're not bad at parenting.
You're parenting on Hard Mode with broken controller.

---

**BREAKING THE CYCLE:**

Your kids need:
• Regulated parent (not perfect parent)
• Repaired connection (not no mistakes)
• Emotional honesty ("Mummy got overwhelmed")

They DON'T need:
• You never getting angry
• You hiding all your struggles
• You pretending to be neurotypical

---

**SENSORY ACCOMMODATIONS:**

Reduce input:

SOUND:
□ Loop earplugs (reduce volume, keep safety cues)
□ Noise-canceling headphones (when safe to use)
□ Quiet time built into schedule (30 min daily)
□ Lower expectations on noise ("indoor voices" may not be realistic)

TOUCH:
□ "I love you but I can't handle hugs right now"
□ Soft clothing only (no scratchy uniforms at home)
□ Weighted blanket for you (regulates your nervous system)

VISUAL:
□ Reduce visual clutter (toys in bins, not scattered)
□ Dim lights when possible
□ Sunglasses indoors if needed

ROUTINE:
□ Visual schedule for kids (reduces questions)
□ Automate everything possible (same breakfast daily, same bedtime routine)

---

**THE 3-MINUTE RULE:**

When you feel snap coming:

BEFORE you explode:
"I need 3 minutes alone. I'll be right back."

Lock bathroom.
Cold water.
Breathe.
Return.

This teaches kids:
• Adults have feelings
• It's okay to take breaks
• Regulation is learnable

This is GOOD modeling.

---

**REPAIR SCRIPTS:**

After you snap:

To child:
"I'm sorry I yelled. I got overwhelmed. That wasn't your fault. I'm working on managing my feelings better."

DO NOT:
✗ "If you had just listened..." (blames them)
✗ "You made me so angry..." (unfair)
✓ "I got overwhelmed. I'm sorry."

---

**CAPACITY COMMUNICATION:**

Tell kids your capacity:

GREEN DAY (High capacity):
"Today is a green day. We can do activities, go places, have fun!"

YELLOW DAY (Medium capacity):
"Today is a yellow day. We're staying home. Quiet activities only."

RED DAY (Low/no capacity):
"Today is a red day. Mummy needs quiet. Screen time is okay today."

Use colored cards if easier.
Kids learn to adjust expectations.

---

**OUTSOURCE EVERYTHING POSSIBLE:**

You don't have to do it all:

□ Online grocery delivery (executive function saver)
□ School uniform in bulk (never think about it)
□ Meal kit services (HelloFresh, Gousto)
□ Cleaner (even once a month helps)
□ After-school club (not neglect—it's capacity management)
□ Partner takes specific tasks (bath time, bedtime, etc.)

---

**THE SENSORY REGULATION MENU:**

When kids overwhelmed (helps you too):

HIGH ENERGY:
• Trampoline
• Dancing
• Running in garden
• Pillow fight

CALMING:
• Weighted blanket
• Dimmed lights + quiet music
• Play-Doh or slime
• Audiobook

RESET:
• Cold water play
• Snack (blood sugar affects behavior)
• Outside (even 5 minutes)

---

**MANAGING SCHOOL STRESS:**

Common ND parent struggles:

MORNINGS:
□ Set out clothes/bags night before
□ Same breakfast daily (no decisions)
□ Buffer time (leave 15 min early)
□ Accept late days happen (world won't end)

HOMEWORK:
□ Same time, same place daily
□ Use body-doubling (you sit nearby working)
□ Accept "good enough" (perfection not required)
□ Request accommodations if child also ND

COMMUNICATION:
□ Ask school to email, not call (reduces anxiety)
□ Set boundaries on response time ("I respond to emails within 24 hours")
□ Disclose if helpful: "I have ADHD, I need written instructions"

---

**PARTNER SCRIPTS:**

To partner:

"I need you to take [bedtime/bath/morning routine] entirely. I'm too overstimulated by evening."

"When I say I need a break, I need you to take over immediately, not in 5 minutes."

"I'm not being dramatic. I'm genuinely dysregulated. I need your help."

If partner doesn't get it:
Show them this. Or have them read about ND parenting.

If partner still doesn't help:
This is bigger problem than parenting. Consider couples therapy.

---

**SINGLE PARENT MODIFICATIONS:**

If you're solo:

Build support network:
□ Other parents for playdates (kids tire each other out)
□ Family help (even video call counts)
□ Paid help if possible (babysitter, cleaner)
□ School breakfast club (buys you morning space)

Ask for accommodations:
□ From school: "I'm a single parent with ADHD, I need flexibility on pickup times"
□ From work: "I need WFH option for school runs"

You're doing impossible job alone.
Lower the bar.
Survival mode is valid.

---

**WHEN YOU'RE THE ND PARENT OF ND CHILD:**

Double challenge:

Both dysregulated = meltdown collision
Both need routine = rigidity conflicts
Both have RSD = heightened emotional reactions

What helps:
• Separate regulation spaces (you each have "calm corner")
• Signal system (green/yellow/red for both of you)
• Shared language ("We're both overwhelmed, let's reset")
• Lower expectations (house might be chaos, that's okay)

You understand them better than NT parent would.
That's your superpower.

---

**SHAME INTERRUPTION:**

When voice says: "You're a terrible parent"

Reality check:
□ Are kids fed? (doesn't have to be perfect meals)
□ Are kids safe? (roof, supervision)
□ Do kids know you love them? (even if you yell sometimes)

If YES to these: You're doing enough.

Perfect parenting is myth.
Regulated parenting is goal.

## TRIGGER: HARMFUL
**POST:** When you're the problem: Recognizing your own harmful patterns

```
⚠️ Relationship Harm-Reduction Kit

Recognizing a pattern you can't break alone?

Sometimes we're the ones causing harm.

---

**CRITICAL SAFETY CHECK:**

Are you being abusive?

ABUSE is about power + control:
• Do you isolate them from friends/family?
• Do you control their money?
• Do you threaten them?
• Do you physically harm them?
• Do you track their location/phone?
• Are they afraid of you?

If YES to any: Call Respect: 0808 802 4040
(Help for people causing harm in relationships)

---

**ND PATTERNS THAT HURT (But aren't abuse):**

1. RSD RAGE SPIRALS
Pattern: Partner says neutral thing ("Can you do dishes?")
Your brain: "They think I'm useless and hate me"
You: Lash out accusingly
Them: Bewildered
You: Chemical flood
Impact: THEY STILL GOT HURT

2. SHUTDOWN STONEWALLING
Pattern: Conflict happens, you go non-verbal
You: Can't process, can't speak, need space
Them: Feels like silent punishment
Impact: Emotional abandonment for hours/days

3. WEAPONIZED VULNERABILITY
Pattern: "I can't handle this, I'm too overwhelmed"
Used STRATEGICALLY to avoid accountability
Your struggles are real AND you're dodging consequences

4. IMPULSE BOUNDARY VIOLATIONS
Pattern: ADHD impulsivity + new person = emotional/physical cheating
"It just happened" is true
AND not enough

5. EMOTIONAL DUMPING
Pattern: You're dysregulated, vent for hours
Partner becomes unpaid therapist
Their needs disappear under weight of yours

---

**THE HARD QUESTION:**

"Am I abusive or just struggling?"

TEST:
• Abuse = power + control, escalates, you blame them, you don't take responsibility
• Struggling = regulation issues, you feel awful after, you want to change, you take ownership

BUT: Harm is harm regardless of intent.
Their pain is real even if you didn't mean it.

---

**WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU REALIZE:**

Step 1: STOP EXPLAINING, START ACKNOWLEDGING

DON'T:
"I only yelled because my RSD was triggered by—"

DO:
"I yelled at you. That was harmful. I'm sorry."

Context can come LATER.
Acknowledgment comes FIRST.

---

**HARM-REDUCTION PROTOCOLS:**

RSD PROTOCOL:
"If I start spiraling, I will:
• Take 10 minutes alone
• Text you 'I'm flooded, not angry at you'
• Use pre-written script: 'I'm having RSD reaction, give me space to reality-check'"

SHUTDOWN PLAN:
"When I go non-verbal, it means:
• I need [X time] alone
• I'll be back in [X hours]
• Here's a card I can hand you:

[CARD TEXT]
'I'm shutdown. Not angry. Need space. Will check in at [time].'
"

REPAIR TIMELINE:
"I will re-initiate repair within 24 hours, even if still processing."

---

**TRACKING THE PATTERN:**

Keep log:

Date: ___/___
What triggered me: ___________
What I did: ___________
Impact on partner: ___________
What I should have done: ___________

After 2 weeks: PATTERNS EMERGE.

Share log with therapist or partner (if they consent).

---

**GETTING OUTSIDE SUPPORT:**

Your partner CANNOT be:
• Your therapist
• Your coach
• Your accountability system

You need:
□ Therapist (ND-informed)
□ Support group
□ Structured intervention (SOR7ED offers this)

They need:
□ Their own therapist
□ Space from being your caretaker
□ Right to leave if they choose

---

**REPAIR SCRIPTS:**

Immediate repair:
"I [specific action]. That hurt you. I'm sorry."

Then stop talking.
Let them respond.

Later repair:
"I've been thinking about [incident]. I understand now that I [impact]. I'm working on [specific change]."

NOT:
"I'm sorry you felt..." (invalidates their feelings)
"I'm sorry but you..." (deflects blame)

---

**WHEN THEY'RE CONSIDERING LEAVING:**

If they say: "I can't do this anymore"

DON'T:
✗ Beg
✗ Promise to change (words mean nothing now)
✗ Guilt-trip ("After everything I've done for you")
✗ Threaten self-harm

DO:
✓ "I understand. I've hurt you."
✓ "What do you need from me right now?"
✓ "I'm getting help regardless. For me, not to force you to stay."

---

**ACCEPTING CONSEQUENCES:**

Sometimes repair isn't enough.
They might leave.

That's their RIGHT.

You don't get to demand they stay while you "work on it."

The work is for:
• You
• Your future relationships
• Not to force reconciliation

If they leave:
• Respect their boundary
• Don't contact unless they initiate
• Actually do the work
• Learn for next relationship

---

**WHEN TO LEAVE YOURSELF:**

Consider leaving if:

□ You keep hurting them despite interventions
□ You feel contempt more than love
□ You use ND traits to manipulate rather than explain
□ You're not actually changing
□ The relationship brings out your worst patterns

Kindest thing might be to leave.
Not because you're unfixable.
Because THIS relationship isn't place for your growth.

---

**DISCLOSURE TO NEW PARTNERS:**

Eventually you'll need to say:

"I have ADHD/autism. Sometimes I [specific pattern]. This isn't excuse, it's context. Here's what I'm doing about it: [therapy/protocols/accountability]."

If they can't handle this: Incompatibility.

---

**THE BOTTOM LINE:**

ND struggles EXPLAIN behavior.
They don't EXCUSE harm.

You can be:
• Struggling with regulation
• AND causing real damage
• AND responsible for changing

All three true at once.

• Respect: 0808 802 4040 (help for people causing harm)

---

What SOR7ED can help with:
• Building harm-reduction protocols (RSD scripts, shutdown cards, repair timelines)
• Weekly accountability check-ins (pattern tracking)
• Couple communication scripts (for crisis moments)
• Therapy prep (what to tell therapist to get ND-informed help)

We're not therapists.
But we can help you build rails so therapy actually sticks.
