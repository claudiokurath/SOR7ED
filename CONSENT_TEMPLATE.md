# TRIGGER: CONSENT
**POST:** Clear consent: Scripts, signals, and ND communication

```
🤝 The Consent & Boundary Protocol

Communication isn't natural—it's a skill.
For ND people, reading subtle cues is hard. For their partners, NT cues might be missed.

This protocol creates an explicit, low-friction system for intimacy and boundaries.

---

**THE ND CONSENT CHALLENGE:**

• Freeze Response: Inability to say "No" even when uncomfortable.
• Context Blindness: Missing the "vibe" or non-verbal signals.
• RSD: Fearing that a "No" means "I don't love you."
• Sensory Overload: Suddenly being "touched out" without warning.

---

**THE SIGNAL SYSTEM (Traffic Lights):**

Instead of complex explanations, use simple colors:

🟢 GREEN: "I'm fully engaged and enjoying this. Keep going."
🟡 YELLOW: "Stop/Pause. Check-in. I'm overstimulated or unsure. Slow down."
🔴 RED: "Stop immediately. I need space/to be alone. Not about you, about my system."

*Agreement:* A Red signal requires zero explanation and carries zero penalty/shame.

**COMMUNICATION SCRIPTS:**

To your partner (Pre-game):
"My brain sometimes gets overwhelmed by touch without me noticing. Can we use the Traffic Light system tonight? It's not about rejecting you; it's about me staying safe."

During intimacy:
"Can we pause for a second? I'm hitting a Yellow. I just need to [breathe/change position/dim lights]."

Afterwards:
"I really appreciated you listening to my Red/Yellow signal. It makes me feel much safer being with you."

**HARM REDUCTION: THE FREEZE RESPONSE**

If you feel yourself 'Freezing' but can't speak:
1. Establish a physical 'Safe Word' (e.g., Double tap your partner's arm).
2. Use a specific 'Recovery Item' (e.g., A specific heavy blanket you use only after intimacy).
