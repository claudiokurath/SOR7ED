# TRIGGER: AGENCYPLAN / WAKE
**POST:** Porn, dopamine, and dissociation

```
🧠 The Wake-Up Protocol (AGENCYPLAN)

Stuck in a dissociation loop or porn/scrolling spiral right now?

This isn't about morality—it's about brain chemistry. 
You're not "bad," you're under-stimulated and seeking a dopamine flood to escape overwhelm.

---

**THE SHAME-FREE REALITY:**

Dissociation is a survival mechanism:
1. High Stress / Boredom → Nervous system feels unsafe
2. Search for Safety → Seeking the highest available dopamine (Porn, Scrolling, Gaming)
3. The Loop → Temporary relief followed by "Dopamine Crash" (Shame)
4. Result → more stress, more dissociation

**IMMEDIATE 'WAKE' ACTIONS (Next 5 Minutes):**

Step 1: SHOCK THE SYSTEM
• Splash ICE COLD water on your face. 
• Hold it there for 20 seconds. 
• This triggers the Mammalian Dive Reflex and instantly lowers your heart rate.

Step 2: PHYSICAL BOUNDARY
• Put the device in another room.
• Physically move your body to a different environment (even just a different chair).

Step 3: SENSORY GROUNDING (5-4-3-2-1)
• 5 things you see
• 4 things you can touch
• 3 things you hear
• 2 things you can smell
• 1 thing you can taste

**THE AGENCY PLAN:**

If you feel the urge to dissociate/scroll:

□ Is my body hungry/tired/thirsty? (H.A.L.T)
□ Am I avoiding a specific task? (Task paralysis)
□ Am I overstimulated by my environment? (Sensory debt)

**If avoiding a task:**
Set a timer for 5 minutes. Do ONLY one tiny part of the task. 
(e.g., Open the doc, put on gym shoes, wash ONE plate).

---

**LONG-TERM INFRASTRUCTURE:**

□ Software Barriers: 
  Install 'Screen Time' or 'Freedom' to lock out apps after 10 PM.

□ The "Dopamine Menu":
  Have a list of 5-minute activities that give "clean" dopamine (stretching, cold water, loud music).

□ Environment Design:
  Charge your phone in the kitchen, not the bedroom.
